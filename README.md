# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

SE is applying the principles of engineering systematically to software development.
Importance: SE ensures that applictaions meet user expectations and functions as intendent.
            SE protects the software from cyber threads.
            SE improves effeciency and productivity.
            SE tests for bugs and system failures.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
- Rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Develop high-level and well detailed designs of the architecture of the software and user interface.
Implementation- Write a code and develop a software according to the design specifications.
Testing- Do numerous tests to ensure the software has proper standard and functions well.
Deployment: Release the software to users
Maintanance: Update and enhance the software after deploying it.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Approach**
Waterfall- sequencial, phase based
Agile- Repetitive and increamental
**Process**
Waterfall- Follows a step by step process
Agile- Works in small cycles
**Testing**
Waterfall- Done after development
Agile- Testing done continuously through development
**Scenareos**
Waterfall- Building a banking system, government and regulatory projects that have strict legal complience
Agile- Creating mobile games, e-commerce website

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
